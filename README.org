* This repo contains various implementation for a brainfuck interpreter
It's an interesting exercise, it's simple and, even after a simple "hello world!", it let you appreciate better other programming language.
* Current implementation:
+ C
+ Elisp
+ Java
* Other language that I want to use:
+ Haskell
+ awk
+ rust (This is really interesting, but for now I don't know it very well)
+ Prolog
